# Module Three final project

## Design Requirements

All applications must be accompanied by project design documents, wireframes, mockups, and/or diagrams.
 * Required design documents must be submitted along with the source code in the `client/design` folder.
 * Recommended design documents are optional.

### Required

* Documentation of functional requirements to act as the application's Minimum Viable Product ([MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)).
  * A functional requirement describes what the application can do or provide from a user's perspective.
  * Functional requirements can be encapsulated into a *[user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)*. For example,
    * "As an authenticated user, I can click the "Cart" link on the navigation bar to visit my shopping cart."
    * "As an anonymous or authenticated user, on the Products page, I can view the product list as a tiled view or a table view, by clicking the appropriate icon."
* [Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-wireframing/)
  * Show the **basic** page layout
    * Header, footer, main content area, navigation, headings, whitespace/padding
    * Indicate interactive elements
      * Buttons, links, forms, dropdown menus, pop-ups ([modal](https://www.digitalsilk.com/digital-trends/modal-in-web-design/)), switches
    * Placeholder images
    * Mock text and mock data
  * Indicate the transitions between pages
  * A separate wireframe for every page view in your application
  * A separate wireframe for mobile and desktop page views
    * Desktop view is 1024 pixel width or greater
    * Mobile view is 425 pixel width or smaller
  * Can be created by hand or digitally using an online tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
    * Here are some [examples](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/learning/handbooks/agile-handbook/wireframe.jsp) of wireframes
    * Place your wireframes in the `client/design` folder


### Recommended

* Choose a color scheme for your site
  * example: https://coolors.co/
* Choose Typography
  * example: https://fonts.google.com/
* Choose icons
  * example: https://fontawesome.com/

## Creating or Extending your own Application

If you decide to create your own application or extend upon your mid-module project, **you must confirm your Application proposal with your instructor.**

### Custom Project Requirements

The following are the minimum requirements your application must include:

* Documentation of at least **7 functional requirements**
  * Must requirements must reference at least two users: an anonymous user and an authenticated user
    * Anonymous user: a person who hasn't yet logged into the application
    * Authenticated user: a person who has registered with and logged into the application
  * At least 3 requirements must include an authenticated user
  * The 3 provided login, logout, and registration requirements **can not** be included as a part of the 7 functional requirements
* Must use Vue.js and associated tooling to create a front-end web application.
  * A front-end web application using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript is **not** acceptable
* Must include at least 3 pages (views)
  * Must use Vue Router to transition between the pages (views)
  * The provided login, logout, and registration pages **can not** count towards the 3 pages
* Must implement the 3 functional requirements for user registration, login, and logout listed below
* Must consume a REST API hosted by a web server created using Spring Boot and Postgres either created by the student or provided by your instructor
  * This will be the module-2 final project unless an exception is granted by your instructor
  * The application must enable users to either create, update, or delete data in the database through the REST API
  * The application must dynamically display at least 5 JavaScript objects from an array obtained from the REST API
    * **Hard-coding data in a JavaScript array/object or in the HTML section is not permitted**
* Styling that utilizes CSS flexbox and/or CSS grid
  * You may use other CSS libraries (bootstrap, tailwind, etc.) to *supplement* your CSS styling
* No horizontal (left or right) scrolling of the page in the browser window
* Support for both desktop and mobile views
  * Desktop view is 1024 pixel width or greater
  * Mobile view is 425 pixel width or smaller
* At least 5 custom event listeners and event handlers that respond to user input
  * An event listener for `DOMContentLoaded` can not be used as one of the 5 event listeners
* A clear purpose, function, or utility

#### Registration and login functional requirements
The following 3 functional reaquirements **must** be implemented for all custom projects.

* As an anonymous user, I can register a new account
  * This feature already exists—**you just need to style the registration page**
* As an anonymous user, I can login using an existing username and password
  * This feature already exists in the starter code—**you just need to style the login page**
* As an authenticated user, I can click "Logout" to logout of the application
  * After logout, the system redirects me to the Login page
  * This feature already exists in the starter code


## Starter Code

### Server setup

Begin by copying the server code from your `java/module-2/week-9/final-project` folder to the `java/module-3/week-9/final-project/custom/server` folder of this project. 
```
cd ~/workspace/[YOUR_NAME]-student-code/
cp -r java/module-2/week-9/final-project/* java/module-3/week-9/final-project/custom/server/
```

Open the server project that you just copied to `java/module-3/week-9/final-project/custom/server` in IntelliJ and review the code. Go to `src/main/resources/application.properties` of your Java project and confirm that the `server.port` setting has the value of 9000:

```conf
server.port=9000
```

For **every controller class** in the `controller` package, add the `@CrossOrigin` annotation above the class definition

```java
@CrossOrigin  // <-- add to each controller class
@RestController
public class AuthenticationController {
```

### Front-end setup

Open the `client` folder in Visual Studio Code.

Take a moment to review the `.env` file that's located in the root of the project. You can store environment variables that you want to use throughout your application in this file. When you open it, you'll see a variable that stores the URL of the API provided by the Module Two final project:
​
```conf
# Java
VITE_REMOTE_API=http://localhost:9000
```

*Note:* As you previously confirmed, the Java Spring Boot application runs on port 9000 instead of 8080.

Open a terminal window and download any dependencies by running this command:
​
```bash
npm install
```

Finally, start your Vue application with the following command:
​
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Authentication
​
When you first run the project and visit the base URL, you're taken to the home page. If you look in `src/router/index.js`, you'll see that the route objects contain a `meta` object containing `requiresAuth`.
* If the value of `requiresAuth` is true, then that route can only be accessed after a successful user login.
* If the value of `requiresAuth` is false, then login is not required.

```js
{
  path: '/',
  name: 'home',
  component: HomeView,
  meta: {
    requiresAuth: true
  }
},
{
  path: "/login",
  name: "login",
  component: LoginView,
  meta: {
    requiresAuth: false
  }
},
```

You'll also see the following code, which prevents any **anonymous user** from visiting certain routes. An anonymous user is someone who hasn't logged in to the site and therefore doesn't have a token.

This code ensures that when such a user attempts to visit a route that requires authentication, the router instead directs them to the login page:
​
```js
router.beforeEach((to) => {

  // Get the Vuex store
  const store = useStore();

  // Determine if the route requires Authentication
  const requiresAuth = to.matched.some(x => x.meta.requiresAuth);

  // If it does and they are not logged in, send the user to "/login"
  if (requiresAuth && store.state.token === '') {
    return {name: "login"};
  }
  // Otherwise, do nothing and they'll go to their next destination
});
```

### AuthService
​
In the `services/AuthService.js` file you'll notice there is no `axios.create()` method call.

```js
import axios from 'axios';
​
// axios.create() not needed, baseURL set in src/main.js

export default {
​
  login(user) {
    return http.post('/login', user)
  },

  register(user) {
    return http.post('/register', user)
  }
​
}
```

The axios baseURL is set globally for all axios calls by default in `src/main.js` using the `VITE_REMOTE_API` environment variable set in the `.env` file.

```conf
// .env
VITE_REMOTE_API=http://localhost:9000
```

```js
// src/main.js
axios.defaults.baseURL = import.meta.env.VITE_REMOTE_API;
```

### Vuex
​
The state for this application is stored in `src/store/index.js` using Vuex. The state object has two values: `token` and `user`. When you log in, the back-end service returns an authentication token along with your user credentials.
​
The authentication token is sent in the `Authorization` header to verify your identify. To persist this token when the application is closed or the page is refreshed, you'll store the token in local storage.
​
The default token either comes from local storage or it's set to an empty string. As you learned in the previous section, if the route requires authentication and this token is empty, it redirects the user to the login page:
​
```js
// src/main.js
const currentToken = localStorage.getItem('token');
if (currentToken) {
  // Set token axios requests
  axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${currentToken}`;
}
​
// src/store/index.js
export function createStore(currentToken, currentUser) {
  let store = _createStore({
    state: {
      token: currentToken || '',
      user: currentUser || {}
    },
    // ...
  });
}
```

### Login

When you call the `SET_AUTH_TOKEN` mutation, several things happen.
​
First, you set the `state.token` value to what's returned from the API's `/login` method. Next, you store that same value in local storage so that it persists across refreshes. Finally, you set the `Authorization` header in Axios so that every subsequent request contains the token. This way, you don't have to manually do this on every request:
​
```js
mutations: {
  SET_AUTH_TOKEN(state, token) {
    state.token = token;
    localStorage.setItem('token', token);
    axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
}
```

### Logout
​
When the `LOGOUT` mutation is called, the token is removed from local storage AND the token and user state are cleared.

```js
mutations: {
  LOGOUT(state) {
    localStorage.removeItem('token');
    localStorage.removeItem('user');
    state.token = '';
    state.user = {};
    axios.defaults.headers.common = {};
  }
}
```

## Hints

### Currency formatting

To show the product's price in the proper format, you can use the `Intl.NumberFormat` object. `Intl.NumberFormat` accepts `locale` and `options` as arguments. `locale` specifies the region whose formatting rules you want to use. `options` allows you to specify what type of formatting you want to apply to your number.

For example, to display a value in U.S. Dollars (USD):

```javascript
Intl.NumberFormat(`en-US`, {
        currency: `USD`,
        style: "currency",
    }).format(value);
```

For a more extensive description of the capabilities of `Intl.NumberFormat`, check out [Mozilla's documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat).

### Font Awesome icons

**Font Awesome** is an open source provider of icons, many of which you can use for free.

If you recall, the mid-module project had the Font Awesome library imported with a `<link>` tag. While you can still use that method with a Vue application, there are also `npm` packages that provide Font Awesome icons.

This project has packages from `fortawesome`—that's not a typo, it's an open source fork of the Font Awesome library. The usage is very similar, instead of `<i>` tags you use `<font-awesome-icon>`.

Previously, you'd use this code to display a heart icon:

```html
<i class="fa-solid fa-heart"></i>
```

The equivalent code with the `font-awesome-icon` component is:

```html
<font-awesome-icon icon="fa-solid fa-heart" />
```

Notice that the values you used for the `class` attribute are now used for the component's `icon` prop.

You can still use the `class` attribute to provide CSS styling. For example, assume you've created an `action-button` class that you want to add to the icon:

```html
<font-awesome-icon icon="fa-solid fa-heart" class="action-button" />
```

You can find other examples of `<font-awesome-icon>` in the starting code of this project, and the Module 3 Sample Application.

Note that you must import and add icons in `src/main.js`. There you'll see these lines:

```js
import { faCartPlus, faTrashCan, faXmark, faMagnifyingGlass, faRotate, faTable, faGrip }
  from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'

library.add(faCartPlus);
library.add(faTrashCan);
// ...
```

To add the heart icon, add `faHeart` to the import:

```js
import { faCartPlus, faTrashCan, faXmark, faMagnifyingGlass, faRotate, faTable, faGrip, faHeart }
  from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
```

And add it to the `library`:

```js
library.add(faCartPlus);
library.add(faTrashCan);
// ...
library.add(faHeart);
```

You can use the [Font Awesome icon search](https://fontawesome.com/search?m=free&o=r) or the [Fort Awesome icon browser](https://fortawesome.com/sets/starter) for icons.

### About favicon

A "favicon" is the small icon that you see on the browser tab when you navigate to a web page or application. When Vue creates a starter project for you, it supplies the familiar Vue "V" icon as your application's favicon. When you run this project, you'll see a different icon—one for the SS Geeks online store. It may interest you how to do this in your own project.

* First you need a very small picture (the SS Geeks favicon is 48 by 48 pixels) in the format of a `.ico` file. There are tools online for creating a `.ico` from a `.jpg` or `.png`.
* In your project, drop the file into the `/public` folder. In this project, the file is `/public/favicon-alien.ico`.
* In `index.html`, in the `<head>` section, add a `link` to the icon file:

```html
<head>
  ... other stuff, like meta tags and title
  <link rel="icon" href="/favicon-alien.ico"> <!-- you don't need to include `public`, Vue automatically copies files from `public` to the root of the web server -->
</head>
```
